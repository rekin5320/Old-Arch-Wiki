# Important: this no longer works
Since some time the parameter `useskinversion=1` no longer works.

# Old-Arch-Wiki (Chrome extension)
Automatically adds the `useskinversion=1` parameter to all Arch Wiki URLs to enable the good old full-width layout.

To install it in Chrome, you need to enable developer mode in [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and add it there (because to publish it in Chrome Web Store, you need to pay a fee).

This is Chrome version of [this Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-arch-wiki/).
